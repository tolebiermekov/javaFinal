Task description
The task is to develop a web application â€“ an electronic vote system for students. The system has
a login form, profile page, admin page, home page (main voting page).
Profile page has fields to update first name, last name, group name, age, interests. The page also
shows last votes.
Admin page allows to add/update/delete questions and answer options for voting, add/edit/
remove roles and authorities of users.
Home page shows menu with available pages (menu), shows the question and possible answers
(main part) and also allows to see recent updates in the other questions (vote results up to now).
After the user has voted there is some short statistics among the answers. It is also possible to
review full statistics of the outdated question.
The full statistics includes how each group members answered, if users who answered the same
have common interests.
The items are assessed according to the quality.
The system also has an android application without profile page and the full statistics. The app
only has login page and vote page.

of questions of the same topic and display. Think differently.
